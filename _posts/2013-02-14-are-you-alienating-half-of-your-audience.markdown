There are always buzzwords and phrases going around the industry. It used to be Web 2.0, and more recently HTML5, which I still have to explain to people is simply the latest version of the HTML standard. Anyway, one buzzphrase you will hear cropping up more and more over the next year will be &lsquo;Responsive Design&rsquo;. So what is it and what&rsquo;s the big deal?


## What is Responsive Design?

Simply put, Responsive Design is an approach to digital design which ensures websites (and emails) are easy to use, load quickly and look good on all devices. That&rsquo;s your massive desktop screen, your laptop, your iPad, even your smartphone.

But why is it necessary? Well, with internet usage on mobile phones growing all the time, it will soon be more likely that your website will be viewed by someone using their iPhone on the train, than by someone using their desktop PC at home. Perhaps more importantly, we&rsquo;ve found that, for some broadcasts, more people read their emails on their smartphone than on their desktop/laptop.

So it boils down to this:

> If you don&rsquo;t use responsive design, you could be alienating over half of your target audience.

## So what&rsquo;s our experience?

This is something we take quite seriously at Tribe, and recently took the decision to change our design process to include responsive design as standard. We changed our own site to work across as many devices as possible and since then every site we built HAD to be responsive in some way.

    <figcaption class="media__caption"><a href="http://www.mgchayles.co.uk/">MGC Hayles website</a> looks good on a variety of devices.</figcaption>

For our most recent website we went the whole hog. MGC Hayles were formed as Chartered Accountants and Business Advisers MGC and Hayles merged and as part of their branding we also designed and built their new website. We made sure that all desktop users had a nice experience regardless of their screen size, by putting in &lsquo;break-points&rsquo; where the layout would change if the screen was too small or too big. We also changed &lsquo;click&rsquo; events to &lsquo;tap&rsquo; or &lsquo;touch&rsquo; events, so smartphone and tablet users had a better experience. There&rsquo;s much more than that, but I won&rsquo;t bore you with the details too much.

## HTML emails can be responsive too.

Then we went a step further.

> What if HTML emails could be responsive?

This is probably more vital, with the uptake of mobile email being higher than that of mobile web and the fact that e-marketing campaigns still have the highest ROI of all forms of digital marketing. So we had a go.

Our first attempt was with a simple, one-column layout, our Christmas campaign email. And it worked. It had the highest click-through and open rates I&rsquo;ve ever seen, and with 1 in 4 people opening it on mobile devices, it was definitely worth the added time investment.

The next attempt proved a little more tricky. A double column layout, which on a smartphone, switched to one column. But we did it, for our Tribe Latest email and, I think you&rsquo;ll agree it looks great.

## So&hellip;

If you&rsquo;re thinking of having a website or email built and you&rsquo;ve not thought of responsive design, it&rsquo;s time for a rethink. It&rsquo;s that, or get left behind.
