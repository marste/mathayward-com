Last month Craig and I gave a talk at [Second Wednesday](http://www.secondwednesday.org.uk/), a monthly Nottingham-based event for creative and digital people, entitled The Responsive Web.

The talk, which attracted a record number of attendees, looked at how websites can deliver both tailored design and content for a truly responsive experience. For anyone who couldnâ€™t make it, I posted the script on the [Tribe blog](http://www.tribeuk.co.uk/blog/the-responsive-web/).
