Rob Antill recently launched his website [showcasing his talent for Stereographic photography](http://www.panodrop.com). By the end of the first day it had received over 6,000 hits and the logo masking was the hottest web design topic on Reddit.

I decided to share how it was done over on the [Tribe blog](http://www.tribeuk.co.uk/blog/whats-behind-the-mask/).
