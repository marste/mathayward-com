                <p>A while back I started working on a pretty nice, but simple, <a href="http://behindthescenes.tribeuk.co.uk/go">interactive HTML5 video</a>.</p>

<p>The desire was to promote the <a href="http://www.tribeuk.co.uk/portfolio">art direction</a> service offered by the company I worked for at the time, <a href="http://www.tribeuk.co.uk">Tribe</a>, via well-produced video content.</p>

<p>Although it was all but finished when I left the company a month later, it&rsquo;s taken a while to get the final tweaks done as is always the case with internal projects, especially with the attention to detail Tribe are known for.</p>

<figure class="media">

    <figcaption class="media__caption">Behind the scenes at a Tribe photoshoot</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Now it&rsquo;s alive and kicking on the internet I&#39;m pleased to see it getting some attention over social media. <a href="http://www.chrisjpavey.co.uk">The video alone is excellently put together</a>, but the interactive element just adds that something more.</p>

<p>You can <a href="http://behindthescenes.tribeuk.co.uk/go">take a look behind the scenes</a> on the Tribe website.</p>

            <title>Teach me web design</title>
            <content type="html">
                <![CDATA[<img src="http://mathayward.com/static/images/social/default.jpg" alt="Teach me web design" />
                <p>As a web developer of some 10 years, there are two things I&rsquo;m regularly asked by friends and acquaintances: &ldquo;Can you build me a website?&rdquo; and &ldquo;Can you teach me web design?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The answer to the first question has changed a bit over the years from &ldquo;Yes, for a price&rdquo; to &ldquo;No, but I know someone who can&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve come to value my free time more and more as I&rsquo;ve got older. The answer to the other has always been:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Sure, have you got 5 years?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A number plucked arbitrarily from the air, but large enough to make a point; learning &lsquo;web design&rsquo; is not a quick thing.</p>

<p>Well at least it didn&rsquo;t use to be. Since around about the time I was considering whether to go to university or not, and still today, I&rsquo;ve heard post-grads complain that what they&rsquo;re taught during the 3 or 4 years that leaves them with a heap of debt, is way behind the working practices of the industry. This has always led me to believe that the best way to learn digital design or development is through experience, and that experience took me years to gain (at least to the extent that I would call myself a good developer).</p>

<p>More recently however, we&rsquo;ve seen services like <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a> and <a href="https://www.steer.me/">Steer</a> aim to teach people with little or no experience the skills to become employees in the digital industry, with the later claiming to teach HTML, CSS and Javascript in just 5 days.</p>

<p>This has got me thinking recently;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Q. Could I teach someone all this in 5 days?</p>

<p>A. Most probably, but with a few caveats.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>First of all, I could only teach <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/">HTML</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/">CSS</a> to the latest W3C draft (and so I should) but unfortunately it would take an age to go through every little browser quirk and the preferred solution (if there is one).</p>

<p>Secondly, Javascript is a much bigger fish than people give credit for and it has many uses. Within the 5 days it would most likely only be possible to touch the basics of DOM interaction, animation and AJAX. I wouldn&rsquo;t call this &ldquo;learning Javascript&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s more &ldquo;learning to use Javascript to enhance website interactions&rdquo; - but that&rsquo;s a bit of a mouthful.</p>

<p>And I can only teach the way I work. This is important. In a small case where I might show someone the ropes, the fact that those ropes are Mat Hayward&trade; branded makes no difference to the industry; just another average developer to add to the pool. However, if someone (or someones) is teaching a whole bunch of people at once, churning out &ldquo;job-ready&rdquo; graduates and they&rsquo;ve all learnt to code in the same way, then what differentiates them from each other when they apply for those jobs? Nothing. So how can an employer make that choice? Personally, I&rsquo;d go to the person with some experience.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s important to realise, if you&rsquo;re thinking of taking one (or more) of these courses that, although you&rsquo;ll no doubt learn a lot and will definitely be able to build a website when you&rsquo;ve finished, you should never be done learning. In this industry, that I love and hate in equal measures things change very quickly, and before you know it you&rsquo;re looking over your shoulder at the <a href="http://www.robinrendle.com">young, up-and-coming kids</a> that make you question how much your experience actually counts for.</p>

<p>And while you can be reassured that it does count for a lot, it&rsquo;s important to note that relying solely on that experience will soon enough count for nothing.</p>

            <title>A rant about SEO</title>
            <content type="html">
                <![CDATA[<img src="http://mathayward.com/static/images/social/default.jpg" alt="A rant about SEO" />
                <p>SEO shouldn’t exist. In a perfect world, there would be no place for Brian the Search Engine Optimisation Consultant* or any of his&nbsp;cronies.</p>

<p>Every client includes it on a brief, ‘first page ranking’, ‘top of Google’. That’s easy. Almost every page on every site on the internet is top of Google, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=erskine+mat+hayward">if the search term is specific enough</a>. But that’s not what they want. What they really want is conversions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Search engines present users with the most relevant pages based on the search terms they enter.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The SEO <em>wizards</em> know the ‘tricks-of-the-trade’ to falsify your web page’s relevance for the keywords required, giving your page a higher ranking than it actually deserves, and they’ll happily charge you to do it. They’ll have you believe it’s some kind of magical dark art, passed from generation-to-generation. It’s not. And there are two problems with their ideals and their methods. When Google, Yahoo!, Bing and the others find out these tricks, they change their algorithms in order to nullify them. What’s worse, users tricked into visiting the wrong page, leave. Leading to reduced conversion rates and increased bounce rates.</p>

<p>Google (et al) are in the game to make money, and they do this by serving the most relevant results to their users. Repeated users equal more advertising revenue. And what makes a search engine popular? Getting the best results first time every time. Relevance. It’s in there interest to remove the false results.</p>

<p>To achieve a high ranking that leads to conversions, don’t use tricks and cheats that will be out-of-date by the time your next birthday comes around. Look at the content from the users’ point of view. The best way to appear relevant is to <strong>actually be&nbsp;relevant</strong>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you convince the search engines that your page is the best result? Start by being the best result.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Employing a good web copywriter and a decent development team is a good first step on any project but it’s also a good first step to achieving a true high ranking.</p>

<p>Web copywriters know that search engines love to ignore repetition. They will choose different keywords for each page and write original content to avoid the downfalls of repetition and to encourage in-linking (incoming links from other web pages on different domains).</p>

<p>A page with a large amount of inbound links is obviously influential. A page with inbound links from other influential pages is even more so, and the more influence a page is shown to have, the more relevance it is afforded by the major search engines.</p>

<p>If the content is good enough that it will be linked to, and linked to from influential sites, then the ranking will improve. But it’s possible to help it along without being naughty. If a website is for a business that operates in a localised area, it’s useful to add it to web directories to improve in-linking. The most influential of these are <a href="http://www.google.co.uk/business/placesforbusiness/">Google Places</a>, <a href="http://yell.com">Yell</a> and <a href="http://dmoz.org">Dmoz</a>.</p>

<p>Good developers will always write valid, semantic code and keep page load to a minimum. Search engines like both of these things.</p>

<p>Firstly, semantic code often presents less code and more content, so a greater percentage of the document read by a search engine index will be keywords.</p>

<p>Secondly, while <a href="http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk/2010/04/using-site-speed-in-web-search-ranking.html">Google admits that site speed isn’t a massive factor in search results</a>, it is still a factor and, efforts should be made to make webpages as quick to load as possible. If only for the sake of the user. At Erskine, we’ve started to set global performance budgets on the websites we build. That is, setting a maximum page weight, http requests and response time. It allows us to concentrate on what’s important, content and user experience, without getting carried away with huge images and obtrusive JavaScript animations.</p>

<p>After a website is pushed live, there are a lot of things that can be done to give it a head start. To prompt search engines to crawl a site, it’s possible to submit an XML sitemap to each of them. This file outlines every page on a website, giving each a priority against the others.</p>

<p>Once submitted, a website is then monitored by <a href="http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/">Google Webmaster Tools</a>, a neat little admin system which highlights any crawl errors and other issues, as well as giving tips, and tools, to improve listings.</p>

<p>Of course all of these things can be achieved by SEO consultants too, and there are good ones out there that will use the honest methods outlined above to do so. Unfortunately, there are also those that will happily take the shortcuts that exploit a hole in the system.</p>

<p>Any healthy relationship is based on trust, if one side is regularly faking or lying, they will eventually get ditched when the other side realises. Building an organic high ranking will keep everyone happy. The search engines won’t ditch pages that remain relevant, a website’s users will receive a better, faster experience and site owner’s will achieve those conversion rates they wanted.</p>

<p>What the internet needs, is less SEO <em>sorcerers</em>, and more site owners that actually care about their content. Not just their conversions. These ‘good’ sites will always do better in the long run, even if the ‘evil’ site is at the ‘top’ for a while, like in any blockbuster movie, the baddie will meet a horrible, fiery end. Be patient, be good and update your site regularly. If you build it (well) they will come.</p>

<p><small>* Cue huge backlash from SEO consultants named Brian.</small></p>

<p>The talk, which attracted a record number of attendees, looked at how websites can deliver both tailored design and content for a truly responsive experience.
