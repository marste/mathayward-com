                    <p>Having a friend who works in events for Nottingham Trent University is sometimes useful. When I fancied doing some gig photography his arm was easily twisted. This shot was a happy accident, a test shot when the settings weren&rsquo;t quite right, meant that the movement is captured with the outlines of 4 or 5 faces.</p>
